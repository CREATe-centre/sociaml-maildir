# sociaml-maildir
> A lightweight Maildir wrapper in OCaml.

**Development on this project has ceased.**

This project provided a very simple wrapper around [Maildir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir) folders, either on a local filesystem or in an [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin) database.

## Installation

This library is distributed through [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), simply run `opam install social-maildir`. The [Findlib](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html) package name is `sociaml_maildir`.

## Development setup

Development requires a working OCaml installation and [OASIS](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/) installed. It is recommended that you use [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to install and configure Ocaml and OASIS. Please refer to the `Makefile` for build targets.
